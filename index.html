    <h1>Hi Basecamp!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Jim Rush and I'm a front end developer based in Wellington,
      New Zealand. I'm currently working for RNZ which is our nations largest
      public radio broadcaster. I hold a Bachelor of Science with a major in
      Computer Science from Victoria University in Wellington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basecamp is really great at sharing what they do and how they do it, so
      of I found this .. and I saw it as an opportunity to experiment with a
      few technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      So. I've submitted my CV and cover letter with some more detailed
      background, but I thought I would use this new site as an opportunity to
      show you a few things that I've worked on/enjoy working on.
