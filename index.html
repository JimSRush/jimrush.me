      <h1>Hi Basecamp!</h1>
      <p>My name is Jim Rush and I'm a front end developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I'm currently working for RNZ which is our nations largest public radio broadcaster.</p>
      <p>Basecamp is really great at sharing what they do and how they do it, so of I found this .. and I saw it as an opportunity to experiment with a few technologies.</p>
      <p>So. I've submitted my CV and cover letter with some more detailed background, but I thought I would use this new site as an opportunity to show you a few things that I've worked on/enjoy working on.</p>

      <h1>Some things I've made and enjoy doing</h1>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy creating silly twitter bots and making video games with friends.</p>
      <p><strong>Monster Mountain:</strong>As part of a game jam a few years ago, we made a game where you are a mountain getting rid of pesky climbers</p>
      <p><strong>Coffee Simulator</strong>Live the simple life! Don't forget to enjoy your coffee.</p>
      <p><strong>Soothing landscape bot:</strong> There's a lot going on on twitter, and inspired by a blog post I created a bot to inject some soothing landscapes into the timeline.</p>
      <p><strong>Knuckle tattoo generator bot:</strong>Someone asked me if I could do this for them, so we did it.</p>
      <p><strong>I made this website!</strong>I'd been meaning to play around with Netlify, so here we are!</p>
