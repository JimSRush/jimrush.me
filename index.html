        <h1>Hi Basecamp!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Jim Rush and I'm a front end developer based in Wellington,
          New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently working as a front end developer for <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/" target="_blank">RNZ</a>
          which is our NZ's largest
          public radio broadcaster with a very high traffic digital presence. I hold a Bachelor of Science with a major
          in
          Computer Science from Victoria University in Wellington.
        </p>
        <p>When DHH tweeted about the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-front-end-programmer/"
            target="_blank">front end role</a> in the Research and Fidelity team, well, it's not often jobs like this
          come up...so here we are.
          Basecamp is really great at sharing what they do and how they do it, so of course
          I found <a
            href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3845-effort-in-the-application-sites-that-got-our-attention-and-got-basecampers-their-jobs"
            target="_blank">this blog post</a> and I saw it as an opportunity to experiment with a
          few technologies. The bar has been set!
        </p>
        <p>
          So. I've submitted my <a href="./assets/cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and <a href="./assets/coverletter.pdf" target="_blank">cover letter</a> with some more detailed
          background, but I thought I would use this new site as an opportunity to
          show you a few things that I've worked on/enjoy working on, and talk about why I'd like to work at Basecamp.

        <h2>What I really, really like about Basecamp:</h2>
        <p>
          <p>Judging by the actions and words of many of the leaders at Basecamp,
            it looks like an organisation with a strong moral compass.</p>
          <p>Basecamp has helped countless teams and organisations get on top of their projects, and the flow on effects
            of
            this cannot be understated.
            The way that Basecamp shares so much of what they do is excellent and has benefited countless folks within
            the
            industry. </p>

        <h2>Why I think it could work out, maybe?</h2>

        <p> I have a strong and practical understanding of the fundamentals of
          front end development and tooling, and I love to keep pace with current tech and best practices.
          I am extremely curious and love to learn new things, and when I solve problems and troubleshoot things, that's
          when I learn the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a really strong desire to learn and grow professionally, which I can see is a key value for Basecamp.

        <h2>Some things I've made and enjoy doing:</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not writing reasonably performant Javascript and Ruby, I enjoy creating weird little twitter bots in
          python and making video
          games with friends, mostly using the Unity engine.
