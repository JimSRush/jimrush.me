      <h1>Hi Basecamp!</h1>
      <p>My name is Jim Rush and I'm a front end developer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I'm currently working for RNZ which is our nations largest public radio broadcaster.</p>
      <p>Basecamp is really great at sharing what they do and how they do it, so of I found this .. and I saw it as an opportunity to experiment with a few technologies.</p>
      <p>So. I've submitted my CV and cover letter with some more detailed background, but I thought I would use this new site as an opportunity to show you a few things that I've worked on/enjoy working on.</p>
